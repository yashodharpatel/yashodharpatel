### üßë‚Äçüíª About Me

My name is **Yashodhar Patel**, and my journey into programming began with a simple curiosity that has since grown into a deep passion. I am from **Mumbai, India üáÆüá≥** and currently in my **final year of Computer Science Engineering** at the University of Mumbai.

I‚Äôm currently an **Intern at Oracle**, where I automate cloud infrastructure processes using Python and Shell Scripting and work with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI). Previously, I gained valuable experience as a **Software Development Intern at Drona Pay**, contributing to real-time fraud protection systems. I also served as a **Maintainer at TCET Open Source**, where I honed my skills while working on impactful projects.

Beyond academics and work, I actively **participate in hackathons** to challenge myself and foster continuous growth. Having solved **300+ Data Structures and Algorithms problems**, I remain committed to continuous learning and making a meaningful impact in the tech industry.
